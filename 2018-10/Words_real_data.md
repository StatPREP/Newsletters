At October's StatPREP meeting at the Mathematical Association of America's DC headquarters the new [MAA deputy executive director, Rachel Levy](https://www.maa.org/news/mathematical-association-of-america-welcomes-new-deputy-executive-director-rachel-levy) asked a simple question: What's real data?

A core recommendation of the American Statistical Association's [GAISE report](http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/GAISE/GaiseCollege_Full.pdf) is to "use real data" when teaching statistics. Prof. Levy wasn't looking to prompt a philosophical discussion of the nature of reality, but to define a benchmark. If a widely lauded, consensus report from the world's leading organization of statisticians calls for every introductory course to use real data, we need a way for instructors to know, for sure, whether they are in compliance. And so we discussed what is "real" when it comes to teaching statistics using real data. Our conclusion: 

> Data is real when it has at least 1000 rows, at least 5 variables, and was not initially collected with a primary purpose of teaching statistics.

How did we come up with this definition? In part, we looked at the examples of "real data" in the GAISE report, for instance a dataset on housing with 2930 rows and 80 variables, or a dataset on 53,940 diamonds with 10 variables. But mainly, we looked at the reasons motivating the recommendation to teach with real data: which practices are encouraged and which discouraged. These are: teach statistics as an investigative process, foster active learning, give students experience with multivariate thinking, use technology but focus on concepts.

Why 1000 rows? Working with data on this scale requires using appropriate technology, the sort used in the data workplace. Graphics with 1000 points can be rich enough to see relationships, even when there are multiple variables. And with 1000 rows, a central concept in statistical reasoning, sampling variation, can be shown directly using random selection.

Why 5 variables? "Multivariate" is at least three and there are three basic roles played by variables in data analysis: reponse variable, explanatory variable(s), covariate(s). But we need more than 3 because both categorical and quantitative variables can star in any of these roles. And we need room for students to explore actively which can be as simple as letting them choose which variables to relate to which.

Of course we understand that there is no hard statistical boundary between n=999 and n=1000, just as there is no hard boundary at p=0.05. 

Now that you have precise criteria for the "real" in "use real data," our next task will be to define "use."
