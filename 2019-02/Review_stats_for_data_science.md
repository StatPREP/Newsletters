Review: Stats for Data Science

There is a lot of excitement about the "new" field of data science. Universities are starting up degree programs, colleges are offering data-science courses, and there is a [movement to bring data-science certificates and degrees to two-year colleges](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Education/Two-Year-College-Data-Science-Summit.aspx).

The enthusiasm for data science has many statisticians grumbling. "'Data science' is just a rebranding of statistics." I think it's much more than that. Statistics should be a central component of data science, but data science has many themes that are not well represented in statistics.

Notice that I said, "Statistics *should be* ..." rather than "statistics *is* a central component ...." The use of the present tense is not yet appropriate because the statistics we teach is not yet appropriate to play a meaningful role in data science. Data science is about using data to inform decisions and actions. Consider two basic tasks in data science: prediction and classification. In statistics, however, we focus on description and significance. For instance, just about every intro stats course introduces the confidence interval on the sample mean. That's a form of description. It's certainly not a legitimate form for a prediction since it doesn't tell us the likely range of future events. The statistics emphasis on significance makes sense when our concern is whether we have enough data to support a claim. But in data science, the issue is how to use *the data we have* to do the best job possible to guide decisions. And usually, in data science, the data we have is so large that statistical significance becomes a formality. In any event, the statistical techniques for significance taught in intro stats don't deal with the forces that drive false discovery.

In order to make statistics genuinely central to data science, we have to draw on the many elements of statistical practice and theory that relate to the goals of data science. These do not include the focus on methods for small data (e.g. n = 10) that figure so prominently in intro stats (e.g. the t test). Or consider a procedure that's ubiquitous in intro stats: the chi-squared test for a relationship between two factors. Chi-squared tells nothing about the shape of the relationship nor the practical size of the relationship. And then there's the question of causality. Intro stats is in the no-causality zone, which isn't much use when  the problem is to inform a decision as best can be done with the data already at hand.

All this is by way of motivation for a new book, *Stats for Data Science*. The aim of this book is to embed statistics in the context of data science:  prediction, prediction error, and the selection of useful predictors; causality; models; and so on. But it's not appropriate to review the book here: it's still in draft form and ... I wrote it. Instead, I encourage you to look through it and report your reactions and impressions to me. Undoubtedly, one of your reactions will be shock. *Stats for Data Science* is unlike any statistics textbook you have taught with and you may wonder, "Is this statistics?" Certainly it isn't the statistics that you're teaching now or are likely to be teaching in the near future. But, I think, it is where statistics education should be heading in order to stay engaged with the contemporary uses of data encompassed by data science.

The draft book is available online at <https://dtkaplan.github.io/SDS/preface.html>. Whether your reaction is positive or negative, it will be useful to me to hear it.
